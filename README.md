All of the documentation should go into the documentation folder (like the waterfall methods and BS like that)

Everything else should be added into the Final_Project folder


Steps to using this repository:

1. Make folder in whichever root directory you would like
2. clone this repository
3. Open eclipse at this directory
4. Click "import project from filetree/filesystem
5. You should see the project in eclipse

Becuase Eclipse doesn't have a brain,sometimes you have to refresh the filesystem
in Eclipse after you git pull because eclipse does not update the new files
this should just be a rare problem.
